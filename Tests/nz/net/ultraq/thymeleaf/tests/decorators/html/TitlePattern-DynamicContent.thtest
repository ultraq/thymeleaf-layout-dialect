# Test that title patterns can continue to have dynamic content.  Regression in
# this issue: https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/64

# This test is disabled because I haven't decided what I should do for the error
# encountered by this, in that the layout:include requests for the title, but
# the element is a self-closing one.  The layout:include processor only fills-in
# an elements child elements, but a self-closed one has no children, and I don't
# think it's safe to force the element to become an expanded one.  Also,
# layout:include is deprecated, so I shouldn't really spend more time on that
# processor.
