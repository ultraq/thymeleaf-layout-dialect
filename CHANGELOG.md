   ([#171](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/171))

Version 3.0 of the layout dialect is largely an upgrade to use Groovy 3.0 which
removes the 'reflective access warning' in Java (which is set to become an error
in Java 17) and the deletion of code that has been deprecated in version 2.x.
It's also a step towards becoming a full Java module, applying an automatic
module name and doing some reorganizing of packages in the interim.

I've written a migration guide to help make the assessment of what an upgrade to
3.0 would entail for you.  Check it out on the documentation site:
https://ultraq.github.io/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/migrating-to-3.0/


### 2.5.3

 - Upgrade Groovy to 2.5.14 
   ([#214](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/214))


### 2.5.2

 - Fix from [@silkentrance](https://github.com/silkentrance) for re-declared
   layout fragments in deep hierarchies, where the layout dialect would return
   the wrong fragment from the template hierarchy
   ([#200])(https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/200)


### 2.5.1

 - Fix POM generation issue that declared dependencies as `runtime` instead of
   `compile`
   ([#208](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/208))


### 2.5.0

 - Upgrade Groovy dependency to 2.5.x, fixing bytecode compatibility issues with
   JDK11+ in certain situations
   ([#205](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/205))
 - Groovy metaprogramming enhancements to Thymeleaf objects is now done via
   [extension modules](http://groovy-lang.org/metaprogramming.html#_extension_modules).
   This has led to a slight improvement in performance: ~10% faster to complete
   the included benchmark project on JDK8, memory footprint remains unchanged.
 - Fixed the fragment cache not being cleared when dispatching/forwarding to the
   error page
   ([#189](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/189))
 - Revamped the documentation website on https://ultraq.github.io/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/
   ([#204](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/204))
 - Rolled the benchmark project into this repo so that performance testing can
   be done right next to the code
   ([#192](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/192))
 - Migrated unit tests from JUnit to Spock
   ([#193](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/193))


### 2.4.1

 - Fix missing `positions` value from `GroupingStrategy` sorting method
   ([#185](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/185))


### 2.4.0

 - Allow passing of values up to layout templates using fragment parameters
   ([#157](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/157))
 - Updated how `<head>` element sorting was done so that the `<title>` can now
   optionally be put as the first element, instead of always making it first.
   Also created 2 new sorting strategies that reflect this respecting of the
   `<title>` and other element positions.
   ([#176](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/176))
 - Fixed a bug around nested elements which arose in 2.3.0
   ([#178](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/178))
 - Fixed a bug when self-closing `<html>` tags are used as a root element
   ([#173](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/173))
 - Added an experimental option to allow developers to opt-out of the automatic
   `<head>` merging that normally occurs, useful if wanted to manage that
   section using other Thymeleaf processors
   ([#165](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/165))


### 2.3.0

 - Verification that the layout dialect plays well with Java 9 and Spring 5,
   involved a patch upgrade of Groovy to 2.4.13
   ([#161](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/161))
 - Contribution from [@Vineg](https://github.com/Vineg) to add a
   `layout:collect`/`data-layout-collect` processor that accumulates encountered
   fragments of the same name.  Documentation is still pending, but eager devs
   can take a look at the PR for more details
   ([#166](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/pull/166))
 - A few tool updates for linting, automated testing, and code coverage w/
   Travis CI (included dropping the JDK7 build as I could no longer get a
   supported configuration working on Travis, but the layout dialect still aims
   to support Java 7 for the remainder of the 2.x releases).


### 2.2.2

 - Another decorate processor root element check fix for deep hierarchies that
   include a `th:with` attribute processor (which gets mutated by the various)
   decoration processes)
   ([#127](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/127))
 - Updated [thymeleaf-expression-processor](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-expression-processor),
   which includes a `null` check for parsing fragment expressions, a potential
   fix for ([#151](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/151))


### 2.2.1

 - Fix decorate processor root element check when interacting with high-priority
   custom dialects
   ([#127](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/127))


### 2.2.0

 - Rework how titles are handled to support inline expressions in Thymeleaf 3
   ([#145](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/145))
 - Now that the complete title cannot be known during execution of the title
   pattern processor, remove the exposed "layout context" object which contained
   the title values.
   ([#147](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/147))
 - Implement a more accurate way to check if the decorate processor is in the
   root element of a template
   ([#127](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/127))


### 2.1.2

 - Fix insertion of elements into a `<head>` section that is empty, ie: `<head></head>`
   ([#144](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/144))


### 2.1.1

 - Simplify and fix the "model level" counting algorithm after a better
   understanding of attoparser and how it works
   ([#142](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/142),
   [#143](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/143))


### 2.1.0

 - Be less strict with HTML templates that are auto-balanced by Attoparser
   (usually a result of not knowing which HTML elements cause auto-closing
   behaviours), instead only using tags that are in the original templates to
   influence the "model level".  While this was a great tool for learning more
   about the HTML spec when it errors, it is more in line with how Thymeleaf
   behaves
   ([#138](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/138))
 - Reveal the processed content and layout title values on the `layout` object
   ([#137](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/137))
 - **Huge** improvements to the memory profile of the layout dialect
   ([#102](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/102),
   [#139](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/139))

What follows is a summary of the performance improvements in 2.1.0.  For details
such as the test methodology and changes made, see the full release notes at:
https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/releases/tag/2.1.0

#### Thymeleaf Layout Dialect 2.0.4

![memory usage 2 0 4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1686920/20034461/c17b6eb8-a423-11e6-8fe0-d2a5572f3b8c.png)

Main takeaways:
 - The JMeter test took about 3 minutes to complete (started around the 30
   second mark), with requests taking an average of 1.674 seconds each
 - Old generation space at 99MB
 - 35 garbage collections
 - 27 million object allocations
 - 4 seconds spent in GC
 - Several items taking over 10MB of retained memory (none of them appearing as
   dominators however, so are potentially GC'able, but don't seem to have been collected)

   ![screen shot 2016-11-06 at 1 33 32 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1686920/20034519/aaf7123a-a425-11e6-9a87-857bd3960dc1.png)

 - Majority of the object allocations taking place in the `IModelExtensions.findModel`
   closure, which uses a Groovy feature of dynamic metaclass creation

   ![screen shot 2016-11-06 at 1 36 02 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1686920/20034527/152d07b8-a426-11e6-9a1c-78143ed44895.png)

#### Thymeleaf Layout Dialect 2.1.0

![memory usage 2 1 0-snapshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1686920/20034539/9449f510-a426-11e6-86cc-0fa2ab52e8fe.png)

Differences:
 - The JMeter test took about 1 minute to complete (also started around the 30
   second mark), with requests taking an average of 452ms to complete **(at
   least 3x faster)**
 - Old generation space at 22MB **(memory footprint 1/5th the size)**
 - 21 garbage collections **(40% less GCs)**
 - 7.1 million object allocations **(74% less objects created)**
 - 1 second spent in GC **(75% less time spent in GC)**
 - Only 1 item taking over 10MB of retained memory (dominator profile looking
   mostly the same however)

   ![screen shot 2016-11-06 at 1 51 37 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1686920/20034609/6496e1c8-a428-11e6-9678-4544303b5d97.png)

 - Majority of the object allocations no longer in a Groovy dynamic meta class
   method, but in one of Thymeleaf's utility projects, [unbescape](http://www.unbescape.org/)

   ![screen shot 2016-11-06 at 1 54 42 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1686920/20034622/cf95185a-a428-11e6-8999-894cabde6cde.png)


### 2.0.5

 - Upgrade thymeleaf-expression-processor to 1.1.2, which includes a fix for
   multiline fragment expressions
   ([#140](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/140))
 - Use Thymeleaf's `AssignationUtils` class for parsing variable declarations so
   that variable declarations behave the same way they do in Thymeleaf
   ([#126](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/126))


### 2.0.4

 - Have the `layout:title-pattern` processor work when using `th:utext`/`data-th-utext`
   on the `<title>` tag as well
   ([#136](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/136))


### 2.0.3

 - Kill the rise in memory usage found by
   ([#134](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/134))


### 2.0.2

 - Convert `FragmentProcessor` from a model processor to a tag processor to get
   around model level problems when inserting fragments that may alter the model
   level
   ([#129](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/129))
 - Fix the merging of the `<head>` section in multi-level layouts
   ([#130](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/130))
 - Respect the runtime-configured prefix
   ([#103](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/103))


### 2.0.1

 - Fix `NullPointerException` when using any of the `include`/`insert`/`replace`
   processors with a full template fragment expression
   ([#120](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/120))
 - Restored support for multi-level layouts
   ([#121](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/121))
 - Reduced logging of backwards compatibility warnings to log just the first
   time the compatibility was encountered
   ([#124](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/124))
 - Improved memory usage by not being so wasteful of objects in a few parts of
   the codebase, which in turn fixed a potential memory leak
   ([#122](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/122))
 - Fixed a backwards compatibility problem when using `layout:decorator`
   ([#125](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/125))


### 2.0.0

 - Layout dialect rewritten to support Thymeleaf 3
   ([#68](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/68),
   [Layout Dialect 2.0 milestone](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/milestone/6?closed=1))
 - `layout:decorator` processor renamed to `layout:decorate`, `$DECORATOR_TITLE`
   renamed to `$LAYOUT_TITLE`
   ([#95](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/95))
 - Deprecated `layout:include` processor for the new `layout:insert` processor
   ([#107](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/107))
 - New documentation site created to hold what was turning into a gigantic
   readme!
   ([#115](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/115))

Upgrading to 2.0?  I've written a migration guide to help make the transition
easier.  Check it out on the new documentation pages site, here:
https://ultraq.github.io/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/MigrationGuide.html

As of release there are still some tests that have been disabled and may
cause regressions for these use cases.  They are listed here:
https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/blob/d4f57d08cbf5c70a33cfa45283015811c90a3765/Tests/nz/net/ultraq/thymeleaf/tests/LayoutDialectTestExecutor.groovy#L55-L61
One is a very specific and rare case, another is an undocumented use of the
layout dialect, and the commented one I don't feel I should fix as it feels like
the incorrect use of an element.  For those first 2 cases, I'll work on them in
upcoming patches so they don't hold up the release.


### 1.4.0

 - Change the behaviour of merging `th:with` attributes so that child pages can
   override layout values
   ([#99](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/99))
 - Fixed lack of a 'groovydoc' archive being included with the download bundle
   and Maven artifacts


### 1.3.3

 - Don't copy collapsible whitespace between `<head>` elements during decoration
   ([#92](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/92))


### 1.3.2

 - Prevent `IllegalArgumentException` when using a template with a condensed
   `<head>` section
   ([#90](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/90))
 - Fix fragment scoping so that fragments from one decorator/include/replace
   operation aren't shared with other ones
   ([#87](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/87))


### 1.3.1

 - Restore Java 6 support
   ([#85](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/85))


### 1.3.0

From 1.3.0, this project follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

 - Dialect rewritten in Groovy
 - Dropped the deprecated `substituteby` processor
 - Allow the title to be completely processed
   ([#72](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/72)) before
   expanding the value of `title-pattern`, fixing cases like that described in
   ([#64](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/64))
 - Split out the `<head>` element sorting into a customizable sorting strategy,
   and provided strategies for each of the behaviours that the layout dialect
   has implemented in the past.  See the
   [<head> element merging](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect#head-element-merging)
   section in the README for more details.


### 1.2.9

 - Have all non-element nodes (text, comments) included in the merging of the
   `<head>` section
   ([#70](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/70))


### 1.2.8

 - Contribution from [Oliver Niekrenz](https://github.com/oniekrenz) to fix a
   recursion issue in the way fragments are picked out of templates
   ([#60](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/pull/60))


### 1.2.7

 - Fix for `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`s coming out of the grouping feature
   introduced in 1.2.6
   ([#54](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/54))


### 1.2.6

 - Reduce the amount of whitespace copied surrounding the `<html>` tag
   ([#50](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/50))
 - Start logic to group like elements in the merged `<head>` section together
   ([#52](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/52))


### 1.2.5

 - Restore title fallback behaviour when either content or decorator title
   elements are empty
   ([#45](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/45))
 - Fix title creation when using `th:text` without a `layout:title-pattern`
   processor
   ([#46](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/pull/46))


### 1.2.4

 - Contribution from [Justin Munn](https://github.com/munnja001) to fix bugs in
   the `layout:title-pattern` processor, making it behave more naturally in the
   process
   ([#42](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/pull/42))


### 1.2.3

 - Fix for nested layout fragments using the replace/substituteby processors
   ([#37](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/37))
 - Don't pass arbitrary attributes (ie: anything that isn't an attribute
   processor) up to decorator pages if the content template is a fragment
   ([#39](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/39))


### 1.2.2

 - Allow passing variables for all document types, not just full HTML templates
   ([#32](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/32))
 - Remove the reliance on Thymeleaf's [literal substitutions](http://www.thymeleaf.org/whatsnew21.html#lsub)
   feature for the `layout:title-pattern` processor, allowing devs to use the
   pipe `|` character in their title patterns
   ([#33]((https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/33)))
 - Fix the passing of decorator/content title values up deep layout hierarchies
   ([#34](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/34))


### 1.2.1

 - Restore `layout:decorator` behaviour when using it for deep page hierarchies
   in Thymeleaf 2.1.2
   ([#30](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/30))


### 1.2

 - Works with Thymeleaf 2.1
   ([#26](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/26))
 - `layout:title-pattern` now works on title text created using the `th:text`
   attribute
   ([#28](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/28))


### 1.1.4

 - Minor bugfixes, small refactoring, and a large cleanup as a result of the
   work done towards being compatible with Thymeleaf 2.1.


### 1.1.3

 - Refactored handling of `<title>` elements for when they're lacking in either
   content or decorator templates and the `layout:title-pattern` processor is
   being used
   ([#25](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/25))
 - Added a `layout:replace` attribute processor, an alias of `layout:substituteby`
   (Just like Thymeleaf, the `replace` processor will eventually replace `substituteby`.
   They both perform the same function, but `substituteby` is effectively
   deprecated.)
 - Updated the Eclipse plugin help file to point to the updated 1.1.x processor
   locations.


### 1.1.2

 - Relaxed the root element restriction when using the `LEGACYHTML5` template
   mode due to the way the NekoHTML parser works on HTML fragments
   ([#23](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/23))


### 1.1.1

 - Restore the help/documentation file so that this dialect will appear in
   content assist in the Thymeleaf Eclipse plugin. (I used a new build process
   for the 1.1 branch, and it missed this resource file!  Apologies for that
   folks.)


### 1.1

 - Change package to `nz.net.ultraq.thymeleaf` (dropped the 'web' part).
 - Change XML namespace to `http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout` (dropped
   the 'web' part).
 - Implemented unit tests, using the [Thymeleaf Testing](https://github.com/thymeleaf/thymeleaf-testing)
   library.
 - Added a `layout:substituteby` processor which works much like `layout:include`,
   but with the behaviour of Thymeleaf's `th:substituteby`
   ([#21](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/21))


### 1.0.6

 - Added a help/documentation file so that this dialect will appear in content
   assist in the Thymeleaf Eclipse plugin.


### 1.0.5

 - Added the ability to specify the final `<title>` through a configurable
   pattern, specified in a new `layout:title-pattern` attribute.
 - Made code emit a warning to the logs if the `layout:fragment` element was in
   the `<title>` element (I keep seeing people doing this, even though it's not
   required since the dialect automatically takes the content `<title>` over the
   decorator `<title>`).
 - Made it so that content outside the decorator page's `<html>` element (like
   IE conditional comments) are included in the resulting page
   ([#10](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/10))


### 1.0.4

 - Fixed enforcing of `layout:decorator` element being in the root element,
   leading to a better error message if this attribute is found elsewhere.
 - Fixed the resulting JAR which didn't recreate the proper Maven metadata in
   the manifest section and might have caused it to not be picked up by tools
   like m2eclipse.
 - Fix a `ClassCastException` for cases when `layout:include` was used to
   include entire pages
   ([#7](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/7))


### 1.0.3

 - Added a `layout:include` attribute which works like `th:include` but allows
   for the passing of element fragments to the included page.
 - Allow `th:with` local variable declarations made in the decorator page to be
   visible in content pages during processing
   ([#3](https://github.com/ultraq/thymeleaf-layout-dialect/issues/3))
 - Removed the restriction that the `layout:decorator` tag appear in an HTML
   element since Thymeleaf 2.0.10 relaxed that restriction too (tag must still
