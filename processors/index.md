Processors
==========

The examples in this section:
 - use the XML attribute version of the processors (`layout:*`), but can just as
   easily be swapped for their HTML data attribute equivalents (`data-layout-*`)
   if that's more your style
 - assume that the Thymeleaf template engine is configured with `.html` as a
   suffix.  This is the default in a lot of framework configurations, such as
   Spring Boot.
